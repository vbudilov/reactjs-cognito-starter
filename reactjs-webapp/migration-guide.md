# Migration to Vite Complete

The project has been migrated from Create React App to Vite. Here are the key changes made:

1. Added Vite configuration (vite.config.js)
2. Updated package.json:
   - Removed react-scripts
   - Added Vite dependencies
   - Updated npm scripts
3. Moved and updated index.html
4. Environment Variables:
   - Environment variables now need to be prefixed with `VITE_` instead of `REACT_APP_`
   - Update any environment variables in your .env files accordingly

## Next Steps
1. Update any environment variables in your deployment configurations from `REACT_APP_` to `VITE_`
2. Test the application thoroughly in development and production modes
3. Update any CI/CD pipelines to use the new build commands

## Commands
- Development: `npm start` or `yarn start`
- Build: `npm run build` or `yarn build`
- Preview production build: `npm run preview` or `yarn preview`
